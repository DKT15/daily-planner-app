# Daily Planner App

## Description

Day Planner is a calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app runs in the browser and has dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The user can enter events between 9 am and 5 pm for each hour. When the user clicks the save button any hour, the events are saved into local storage. When the user refreshes the app webpage, their information is saved and will not be lost.

The application has colours for the time blocks to help the user determine past, present, and future events. Time blocks in the past are grey, the present time block are red, and future time blocks are green.
